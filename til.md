## Immediate object types

*Oct 06, 2023 â€¢ Ruby*

Immediate objects(values) in Ruby are objects that do not require memory 
allocation to create and memory indirection to access, and as such they are
generally faster than non-immediate objects.

e.g. `true`, `false`, `nil`, `Fixnum`, `Symbol`

These objcts are stored directly in `VALUE`

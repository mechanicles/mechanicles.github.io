If you're working on a large Rails application with lots of controllers, layouts,
and view pages, it can be tough to figure out which parts of the code are being
called when a request is made. Whether you're new to the project or have been
working on it for a while, the logs can be a bit confusing because everything
looks the same.

To make your life easier, you can use the [colorize_logs](https://github.com/mechanicles/colorize_logs)
gem. It's a handy tool that lets you give different colors to specific logs,
making it much simpler to spot the information you need. Take a look at the
image below to see how it works.

This tool helped me a lot. Now, I don't have to spend too much 
time hunting through logs. I can even use different colors for different log
lines to make things even clearer.

If you want to learn how to use it, just check out the [documentation](https://github.com/mechanicles/colorize_logs).
If you run into any problems or have suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out.
I'm here to make it better, and if you have other ideas, feel free to share them
by opening an issue. I'll be sure to take a look!

Happy debugging!

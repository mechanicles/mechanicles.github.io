Our search specs are now dependent on Elasticsearch and to run
feature/system specs, we need Chrome and Chromedriver software packages in
our system. Recently, I was working on setting up Elasticsearch, Chrome, and
Chromedriver software packages on [Drone CI](https://drone.io/). 

Let's discuss how to set up those software packages and make them ready to serve.

Initially, I went through Drone docs and was able to set up Elasticsearch
quickly using this
[example](https://docker-runner.docs.drone.io/examples/service/elasticsearch/).
But I was not able to find useful information for installing Chrome and
Chromedriver software packages. Tried some docker images, but not able to make
them work.

After investigating, I manually installed Chrome and Chromedriver packages using
commands. Please check following Drone CI code `.drone.yml` and this might help
you.

      - RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec spec

  event:
    - pull_request
```

After these changes, our CI build passed successfully! ðŸš€

Found that chrome installation takes a bit more time. But not sure if Chrome
docker image solves this issue, if it does, I will recommend using that one.

It would be good if anyone knows useful references for installing these software
packages using docker images and making them work, please do let me know. 

Happy **CI**-ing!
